ATM MACHINE
We have to make a Automated Teller Machine in this project. The program is written in simple pyhton language.
In the program we have firstly --> taken Input of 4 digit user pin for authentication -->have to input user pin double times and where they are equal.-->If pin is found okay, ask for the input selection of numbers from 1 to 4.
  1. Check saving balnce and print the balance.
  2. Deposit funds from the user and print the saving bale=ance after deposit.
  3. Withdrow funds from the savings balance account and print the balance after withdrawl.
  4. Transfer funds from checking balance to saving balnce. For this, you have to initially create the variable for checking balance and assign some amount to that variable. If selection 4 is made, the amount from checking balance must be debited and credited to saving account.
  Then, you have to print the balance in checking balance and saving balance. --> If selection is other than 1 to 4, print invalid choice and exit the loop.
